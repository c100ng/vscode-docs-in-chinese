# .NET Core and Visual Studio Code

.NET Core gives you a blazing fast and modular platform for creating server applications that run on Windows, Linux and Mac. Use Visual Studio Code with the C# extension to get a powerful editing experience with full support for C# IntelliSense (smart code completion) and debugging.

## Getting Started

1. Install [.NET Core](https://microsoft.com/net/core).
2. Install the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) from the VS Code Marketplace.

You're all set!
